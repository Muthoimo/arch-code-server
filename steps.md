# Docker Setup for Arch Linux with VS Code Server

This guide will walk you through creating a Docker environment based on **Arch Linux**, with **VS Code Server** (`code-server`) running in a browser, and provide a `docker-compose.yml` to easily manage the container.

## Steps:

### 1. **Dockerfile Explanation**
The `Dockerfile` provided below sets up an Arch Linux container with the necessary development tools, configures a user (`coder`), sets up the locale, and installs **VS Code in the browser** using `code-server`.

```dockerfile
FROM archlinux:latest

# Update the system and install necessary dependencies
RUN pacman -Syu --noconfirm \
    && pacman -S --noconfirm \
    base-devel \
    git \
    sudo \
    zsh \
    go \
    code-server \
    fixuid \
    dumb-init \
    curl \
    --needed

# Enable en_US.UTF-8 locale
RUN sed -i "s/# en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/" /etc/locale.gen \
    && locale-gen

# Set the LANG environment variable
ENV LANG=en_US.UTF-8

# Create the "coder" user and configure sudo with no password
RUN useradd -m -s /bin/zsh coder \
    && echo "coder ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/coder \
    && chmod 440 /etc/sudoers.d/coder

# Set the working directory to /home/coder
WORKDIR /home/coder

# Set the hostname to "arch"
RUN echo "arch" > /etc/hostname

# Copy the entrypoint script into the container
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

# Set the entrypoint for the container to the provided shell script
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]

# Expose the default port for code-server
EXPOSE 8080

# Default command to run code-server (VS Code in the browser)
CMD ["/usr/bin/code-server", "--bind-addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--auth", "none"]
```

#### Key Steps in the Dockerfile:
- **Base Image**: We start with the `archlinux:latest` image, a minimal Arch Linux setup.
- **Install Dependencies**: Updates the system and installs several packages like `git`, `zsh`, `code-server`, and development tools.
- **Locale Configuration**: Enables the `en_US.UTF-8` locale by modifying `/etc/locale.gen` and running `locale-gen`.
- **User Setup**: Creates a user called `coder` with `sudo` privileges, and sets up the working directory.
- **Entry Point**: Uses an `entrypoint.sh` script as the container's entry point to initialize the environment before running `code-server`.

### 2. **docker-compose.yml Configuration**

To simplify the management of your Docker container, here's the `docker-compose.yml` file. This file allows you to build, run, and configure your service with minimal commands.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  coder:
    build: .
    container_name: arch-coder
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Expose port 8080 for code-server (VS Code in the browser)
    volumes:
      - coder_data:/home/coder  # Persist data in the container's home directory
    environment:
      - LANG=en_US.UTF-8  # Ensure the container uses the correct locale
    restart: unless-stopped  # Automatically restart the container unless stopped manually
    stdin_open: true  # Keep stdin open for interactive commands
    tty: true  # Allocate a pseudo-TTY to allow interactive use of zsh

volumes:
  coder_data:
    driver: local  # Creates a named volume to persist data between container restarts
```

#### Key Sections of the `docker-compose.yml`:
- **`version: '3.8'`**: Specifies the version of Docker Compose file format.
- **`services:`**: Defines the services to run in the container. In this case, we have a service named `coder`.
  - **`build: .`**: Tells Docker Compose to build the image using the `Dockerfile` in the current directory.
  - **`ports:`**: Maps the container's port `8080` to the host machine's port `8080`, making `code-server` accessible via the browser.
  - **`volumes:`**: Creates a persistent volume `coder_data` to store user data at `/home/coder` inside the container.
  - **`environment:`**: Sets the `LANG` environment variable to ensure the correct locale (`en_US.UTF-8`) is used.
  - **`restart: unless-stopped`**: Automatically restarts the container unless it's manually stopped.
  - **`stdin_open: true` and `tty: true`**: Keeps stdin open and allocates a TTY for interactive use of the shell (`zsh`).

### 3. **Steps to Build and Run the Container**

#### 1. **Build the Docker Image**:
To build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`, run the following command in the directory containing the Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:
- Build the Docker image based on the `Dockerfile`.
- Start the container defined in the `docker-compose.yml`.

#### 2. **Access Code-Server**:
Once the container is running, you can access **VS Code** in your browser. Navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You will have access to a full VS Code environment, running directly in the browser.

#### 3. **Stopping the Services**:
To stop the services and remove the container, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove the container but leave the persistent volume (`coder_data`) intact.

### 4. **Optional Adjustments**

- **Change Ports**: You can modify the port `8080` if you want to expose the service on a different port. Just change `8080:8080` in the `docker-compose.yml` and adjust the `CMD` in the Dockerfile accordingly.
- **Enable Authentication in Code-Server**: If you want to enable authentication for the `code-server`, modify the `CMD` in the Dockerfile to something like:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["/usr/bin/code-server", "--bind-addr", "0.0.0.0:8080", "--auth", "password"]
  ```
  This will prompt you to set a password for accessing `code-server`.

---

### 5. **Final Notes**

- Using `docker-compose` simplifies the process of starting, stopping, and managing Docker containers. It also handles the networking, volumes, and environment settings for you.
- **Persistent Data**: The `coder_data` volume ensures that any data you store in `/home/coder` within the container is kept between container restarts, making this setup useful for development environments.
- This setup is great for a **browser-based development environment** that you can access from anywhere.

Feel free to ask if you need further customization or explanations!
